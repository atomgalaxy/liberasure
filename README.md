This code was originally developed by Gašper Ažman for a series of lectures on
template metaprogramming and type erasure, while he was working for A9.com. The
original copyright therefore belonged to Amazon.com, inc. However, as part of
internal ticket https://tt.amazon.com/0093001587, the copyright for this code
was assigned directly to Gašper Ažman in October 2016, and Amazon.com, inc. no
longer claims ownership of the code.

The code henceforth belongs to the AUTHORS as detailed in the Github
history.
